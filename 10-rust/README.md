# adder

The second Shokunin challenge... a quick-and-dirty Rust solution after I got stuck with my Elixir solution

> Write a program that adds two (or more) integers, without using any of the plus literal (+),
> the minus literal (-), the add method (or equivalent), the subtraction method (or equivalent),
> the sum method.
>
> The integers can be negative, zero or positive.

## Prerequisites

* Rust 1.6.0

Run `./go.sh check` to test that everything looks OK.

## Running

* Run `./go.sh run <number1> <number2>` to run the application (replace `<number1>` and `<number2>` with your numbers of choice)

## Testing

* Run `./go.sh test` to run the tests

## :warning: A warning

This code is almost certainly god-awful, non-idiomatic Rust code.
